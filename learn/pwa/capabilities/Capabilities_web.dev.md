Progressive Web Apps can do more than just rendering content on the screen or connecting to web services. PWAs can deal with files from the file system, they can interact with the system's clipboard, they can access hardware that is connected to the device, and much more. Every Web API is available for your PWA, and there are some extra APIs available when your app is installed.

You can use [What Web Can Do Today](https://whatwebcando.today/) to know what's possible on each platform. For individual APIs or capabilities, you can use [Can I Use](https://caniuse.com/) or the browser compatibility tables on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/).

## Always check for feature support

The first letter in PWA stands for progressive, and it comes from the idea of [progressive enhancement](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Glossary/Progressive_Enhancement) and [feature detection](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Cross_browser_testing/Feature_detection). You should not expect your app to work the same way on every device. The diversity of contexts and abilities on billions of devices in different countries makes PWAs an excellent platform, thanks to their progressiveness.

This means that you need to develop your app in layers that may not be available on every device and to check availability before usage.

You need to check with JavaScript if an API exists before using it or ask an API if a service is available on that particular device.

## Powerful web

The web is super powerful today. For example:

*   You can build a [hyperlocal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlocal) video chat app with WebRTC, geolocation, and push messages.
*   You can make an app installable.
*   You can add video effects with WebAssembly.
*   You can even bring it into virtual reality with WebGL and WebXR.

## Empowering your PWA

Let's split the PWA capabilities APIs into four groups:

*   Green: APIs available on every browser on every platform, when technically possible. Most of them have been shipped for many years, they are considered mature, and you can use them with confidence. An example API from this group is the geolocation API.
*   Light green: APIs are available only on some browsers. Considering the lack of support on some platforms, they matured within the supported subgroup of browsers so that you can use the capability confidently on them. An example API from this group is WebUSB.
*   Yellow: experimental APIs. These APIs are not yet mature; they are only available on some browsers, and within tests or trials. We talked some about these capabilities in the [Experimental chapter](https://web.dev/learn/pwa/experimental).
*   Red: the group for APIs that you can't use in a PWA, and where plans to add them are still long term. An example API from this group is geofencing.

### Green capabilities

Below is a list of the most important capabilities you can use in your PWA.

#### Basics

*   _Caching files locally_ using the Cache API, as seen in the [Caching chapter](https://web.dev/learn/pwa/caching).

On Safari, you need to use a [non-standard permission dialog request](https://medium.com/flawless-app-stories/how-to-request-device-motion-and-orientation-permission-in-ios-13-74fc9d6cd140) to use them.
*   _Touch and pointer_ access information about all the touches and pointer-based clicks you make with your finger, a mouse, a trackpad, or a pen, thanks to [Pointer events](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Pointer_events) and [Touch events](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Touch_events).

*   _Gamepads_ to read information coming from standard gamepads and joysticks connected to the device using the [Gamepad API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Gamepad_API/Using_the_Gamepad_API).
