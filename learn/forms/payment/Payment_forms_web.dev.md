The payment form is often the last step before completing a purchase. To maximize conversions, ensure your payment form is user-friendly and secure.

## Ensure users know what to fill in

Keep your payment form as simple as possible, showing only required fields.

Indicate the payment amount. The **Submit** button is ideal for that.

```
<button>Pay $300.00</button>  
```  

Use self-explanatory wordings for your `<label>` elements. For example, use 'Security code', instead of an acronym like 'CVV' that's only used by some brands.

## Help users enter their payment details

To maximize conversions, ensure users can fill out your payment form as quickly as possible.

Use `inputmode="numeric"` for the card number and security code fields to show an optimized on-screen keyboard for entering numbers.

Add appropriate `autocomplete` values for your payment form controls to ensure browsers offer autofill. Use `autocomplete="cc-name"` for the name, `autocomplete="cc-number"` for the card number, and `autocomplete="cc-exp"` for the expiry date.

## Ensure users enter data in the correct format

Use the `required` attribute for every `<input>` to ensure users fill out the complete form.

Payment card security codes can be three or four digits. Use `minlength="3"` and `maxlength="4"` to only allow three and four digits.

Ensure users only enter numbers for the card number and security code. Use `pattern="[0-9 ]+"` to allow users to include spaces when entering a card number, since this is how the numbers are displayed on the physical cards.
