Digital accessibility, commonly abbreviated a11y, is about designing and building websites and web apps that people with disabilities can interact with in a meaningful and equivalent way.

This course is created for beginner and advanced web developers. You can go through the series from start to finish to get a general understanding of accessibility practices and testing, or you can use it as a reference for specific subjects. If you read an unfamiliar term, refer to our [glossary](https://web.dev/learn/accessibility/glossary). For those new to web development overall, check out the [Learn HTML](https://web.dev/learn/html) courses for fundamentals with markup and [Learn CSS](https://web.dev/learn/css) courses for styling fundamentals.

**This is not a complete reference**. Each section introduces the section topic, provides context and examples. There are links to topic references, such as [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/) and [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/) specifications, and other [web.dev](https://web.dev/learn) articles. Each section has a short assessment to help people confirm their understanding.

Some accessibility best practices differ, based on the disability you're addressing. It's important to understand your users and to listen to people with disabilities when they tell you what they need.

We are open to your feedback! [Open a bug](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/new?component=1400680&template=1857359) and give as much information as you can so we can address it.
