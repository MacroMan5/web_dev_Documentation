Congratulations, you've made it through Learn Accessibility! At this point, you've learned a lot of best practices for accessibility and gone through multiple rounds of accessibility testing. You may have learned some new terminology or refreshed your memory in our [glossary](https://web.dev/learn/accessibility/glossary).
